		Here is some of my favorite shows or games that I like to watch/play in my past time.
	</p>
    <h2>Image 1:</h2>
		<img src="omori.jpg" alt="Omori">
		<p> 
			I really like omori and, if I could say without spoiling the plot, I would say it has a great message about mental help. 
		</p>
    <h2>Image 2:</h2>
		<img src="yuji.png" alt="Jujutsu Kaisen">
		<p>
			I love the action and storyline of this series. What I like most about it is that doesn't follow within traditional tropes of anime. 
		</p>
	<h2>Image 3:</h2>
		<img src="saitama.png" alt="One Punch Man">
		<p>
			Absolutely love the art that this series provides, One Punch Man probably has one of the best visual in anime. My opinion tho.
